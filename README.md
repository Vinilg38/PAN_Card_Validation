   Execute the `CREATE TABLE` script provided below to create the `PAN_CARD_DATA` table.

2. **Import Data**  
   Import the data from **`PAN Number Validation Dataset.csv`** into the newly created `PAN_CARD_DATA` table.

3. **Run Your Validation Logic**  
   Use Python or SQL queries to validate new PAN numbers against the data in the table.

## ðŸ—„ SQL CREATE TABLE Script

The following script will create a table named `PAN_CARD_DATA` with columns to store the PAN number, the holder's name, and the validation status.
